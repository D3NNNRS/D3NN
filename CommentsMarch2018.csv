Every Southerner and slick Yankee salesman learns how to exaggerate or embroider a story to keep enemies at bay, rivals off balance, and customers salivating.<br/><br/>Donald Trump's florid tastes and personality make hyperbole and falsehoods particularly useful for him and in business and politics. It's the Art of the Deal: you can use a good story to woe potential investors and buyers/fool attorneys and enthuse voters. A little crazy can empower negotiations or cover up bumbling ignorance.<br/>Ivanka understands this and plays along. Jared sort of gets it. The media seem clueless.<br/><br/>Good 'Ol Boy Jeff Sessions understood Trump's act until Jeff faced a prison term for lying to the FBI. Hope Hicks, educated at SMU, recognized Donald Trump's ""White Lies"", ""poetic license"", i.e. ""Southern hyperbole"" to promote his agenda and throw off the FBI/media.<br/><br/>Prior to modern communications systems, TV, and the internet, the South was boring. So, raconteurs learned to weave tall tales known to be exaggerated or even false, for entertainment or ulterior reasons. Trump is an adept raconteur (Shakespeare would hint skillful fool) for ulterior motives. Orange Man is a superb, entertaining bloviator, beloved by his voters and other wits.
